Software engineering is a rapidly evolving field. The technology landscape has been ever changing with innovations in both software tools and engineering techniques. While we see many changes around us, there are a few invariants about how we design systems that have held their grounds and are tried and tested. These nuggets of wisdom or principles help one build systems with strong foundations that make them available, maintainable, secure, and performant. There are recurring design and implementation patterns that help establish these principles in software systems. Over a career of two decades ranging from backend software development to research and development in academic settings to providing technical leadership in developing software products at several Fortune 500 clients, I have had several oppurtunities to learn and apply these principles and patterns. This portal is my attempt at sharing what I have learnt and is continuing to learn to a wider software community.

Hello! I am Chandan Rupakheti -- a practice lead / solutions architect at [DMI](https://dminc.com/) in Indianapolis, IN. My key areas of focus at DMI are event-driven, serverless architectures and DevOps. Before joining DMI, I was a tenured faculty (Associate Professor) at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/). Most of my past research have been focused on Static Program Analysis, Program Comprehension, and Computer Science Education -- view the [Publication](publication.html) section of the portal for details. The [Blog](blog.html) section of the portal archives some of my industry-relevant technical articles.
